# Runs the integration suite against the module as PUBLISHED on the proxy, which
# is the one thing the unit suite cannot check: that suite tests this working
# tree, so it stays green through a tag that was never pushed, a nested module
# that swallowed a file, or an import path a consumer cannot resolve.
#
#   ./scripts/run.sh
#
# Two conditions make the run meaningless rather than failing, and each one skips
# with a reason instead:
#
#   1. Nothing published satisfies the version go.mod requires. Before the first
#      release there is no artifact to test, and unlike an interpreted language a
#      Go test file naming a method that version does not have will not COMPILE,
#      so this gate covers the whole suite rather than one test.
#   2. A tier's staging key is missing. The unauthenticated tests still run, and
#      each tier without a key skips from inside the suite, so the skip and its
#      reason land in the test output rather than in this script's preamble.
